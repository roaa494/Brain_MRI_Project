# Brain MRI Project

A project for analyzing brain MRI images using Machine Learning.  
The goal of this project is to develop a faster and more accurate way to examine and analyze brain scans using the provided scripts and code.

## Project Idea
The project focuses on processing brain image data, preparing it, and running a trained model to detect certain patterns or conditions in the images.  
It can be used for experiments or further medical analysis.

## Current Files
- app.py : Main code to run the application (simple interface to interact with the model).  
- main.py : Script to run the model on new data.  
- train_model.py : Code to train the model (for reference or retraining).  
- requirements.txt : List of all libraries needed to run the project.
