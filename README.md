# Brain MRI Project

A project for analyzing brain MRI images using Machine Learning.  
The goal is to provide a framework for processing brain scans and running a trained model.

## Current Files

- main.py : Script to run the model on new data.  
- train_model.py : Code to train the model.  
- requirements.txt : Libraries needed for the project.  
- data/ : Folder containing the dataset (images).  

## Trained Model

The trained model is available on Google Drive:
